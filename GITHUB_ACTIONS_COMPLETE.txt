GET STARTED IN 3 STEPS

Step 1: Configure GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)
  Add these 8 secrets to: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
  
  DEV_APP_SERVER_IP = 192.168.6.128
  DEV_APP_SERVER_USER = zubair
  DEV_APP_SERVER_PORT = 22
  DEV_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = [paste ~/.ssh/id_rsa]
  DB_SERVER_IP = 192.168.6.129
  DB_SERVER_USER = zubair
  DB_SERVER_PORT = 22
  DB_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = [paste ~/.ssh/id_rsa]

Step 2: Run Deployment (20 minutes)
  Go to: GitHub Actions tab
  Select: Full Application Deployment
  Click: Run workflow
  Watch: Real-time progress

Step 3: Verify (5 minutes)
  Visit: http://192.168.6.128
